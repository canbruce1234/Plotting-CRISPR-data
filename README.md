## Plotting CRISPR data ##
CRISPR data was generated for about 16,000 genes in 342 cancer cell lines of the CCLE, using the CERES algorithm (Meyers et al, 2017). The code given here makes one plot per gene. An HTML page lists all the genes and the gene names are hyperlinked to the individual image files.
